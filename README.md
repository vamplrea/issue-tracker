built an Angular application for managing and tracking issues using reactive forms and Clarity Design System.

Installed Clarity to an Angular application and used a data grid component to display a list of pending issues. Then, we introduced reactive forms and used them to build a form for reporting a new issue.
Added validations in the form to give our users a visual indication of the required fields and guard against unwanted behavior.

An issue tracking system is not efficient if our users are not able to resolve them so a modal dialog using Clarity to resolve a selected issue.

Improved the UX of our application by suggesting related issues when reporting a new one.
